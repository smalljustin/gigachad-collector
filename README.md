# Gigachad Collector

This is a utility that reads car state data from Openplanet and saves it to a server.

Roughly: 
* 'Map tag' is like a name for a map, except multiple maps can have the same name. (E.g., 'stadium dirt', for flat maps with the Stadium car on dirt.)
* 'runkey' is a name for a specific run, or set of runs. If you don't have a particular scenario you're testing, please use 'default'.

This plugin uses Openplanet's authentication systems, so no account registration is required.
